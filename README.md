# politeia-proposals

The Decred project has launched a public proposal system called Politeia.
This repository will store the proposals of Crown Marketing, a digital marketing agency in Vancouver.
We plan to present propsals to the Decred community on how to improve digital content creation, distribution, website conversion optimization, and web analytics reporting.

We look forward to helping build successful projects that enrich the Decred project and community through creative, data backed, proposals.

For more information on Politeia, please review the Politeia Use Cases pdf, written for the Decred Roundtable EP4.
